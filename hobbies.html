                        I’ve been a lifeguard at LifeTime Fitness since I was 16. Lifeguarding has definitely been one of the hardest but most rewarding jobs I’ve ever had. In the 4 years I’ve been there, I have been promoted to a Supervisor role and grown in my professional career.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Some of my favorite memories and people are tied to lifeguarding. Each summer, we all come back from college and work doubles at the pool. It is seriously the best summer job any teenager could ask for. It’s fun and rewarding, but it can also be very stressful at times. We have had emergencies on the pool deck, and my team and I have had to respond to them. Trusting that my coworkers know what to do in an emergency has been a personal challenge for me. But with every shift, I learn and grow.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I’m excited to work over breaks and for next summer. The LifeTime pool deck is a place I hold close to my heart. Whether it's when I’m on stand, or just tanning in a lounge chair on my day off, LifeTime has been a pinnacle place for me.

                        I joined the American Marketing Association in the Spring of my Freshman year. I am now in AMA Leadership as a Board Member. I have competed in two competitions. The most recent one was in Whitewater, Wisconsin. Out of 25 teams and roughly 500 students, I placed 4th in my Digital Strategy and 3rd in my Marketing Strategy.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In AMA, we work with one company a semester. This Fall, we are working with Minnesuing Acres, an executive retreat resort located in Wisconsin. We are giving them a full digital makeover and helping them update their website and increase their customers in the winter months. We got the chance to tour the property, and it was an amazing experience.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        AMA is important to me because, unlike other clubs, where you just socialize and make crafts, AMA works with real companies. We compete, we actually do things that can go on a resume. Joining this club was one of the best decisions I have made since coming to college!

                        One of my favorite things to do is run. I like it because it's a good way to push myself physically. I love waking up at 5am in the summer, before the sun has risen, and going for a run. It’s also good for me on a mental level. Running is my way of decompressing. I run so that I stay mentally sane. I’ve been running since I was in third grade, and it's something I want to continue for the rest of my life.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My love for running really took off when I joined my high school’s cross country and track team. I met so many amazing girls through those sports, and even though I’m not on those teams anymore, I still go to their races and cheer them on. High school, for me, was practicing six days a week, leaving my whole soul out on a track with my teammates.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now that I’m not on a team, I like to run for fun. Running around Duluth has been so cool. Running up these hills, though, that is not cool. I’ve always wanted to run a half-marathon before I turn 20. So that’s something to look forward to this year!
